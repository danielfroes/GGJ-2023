  Description: "As you grew older your bedroom began to have a different meaning.
    You created your own world and wouldn\u2019t let me in. At the time, I thought
    it was just a phase, and as soon as you became an adult, you left to live in
    your own place. Now I understand I had some responsibility for how you felt at
    the time."
