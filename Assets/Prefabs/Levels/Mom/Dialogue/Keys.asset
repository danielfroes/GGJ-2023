  - Text: When you moved out I was devastated. The empty fruit basket syndrome hit
      me really hard. It was very important though, I got to know myself better.
      It made me try and understand you better as well.

  - Text: 'Understand your differences and learn to love them - or at least respect
      them. For some time thinking about it would fill me with guilt, but now I learned

      me that.'
