  - Text: The first actual toy I gave you was one of those cooking kits for kids.
      It had some pots, pans, and even a - nonworking - stove. Every mom who had
      a daughter would give one of them for Christmas.

  - Text: I'm not going to lie I was heartbroken when I realized you absolutely hated
