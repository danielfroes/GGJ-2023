  - Text: I still remember the day we got the key to our home. It was so much more
      than a house - it symbolized the achievement of our goal to build a life together.
      Holding that key in my hand felt like a seed that would start growing great
      memories, and I was filled with a sense of pride and love.

  - Text: Moving in together was a bold step in a world that doesn't always accept
      our love that well, but that key represented our commitment to each other and
      the life we were building.
