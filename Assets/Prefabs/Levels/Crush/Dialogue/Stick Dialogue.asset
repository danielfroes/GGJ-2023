  - Text: 'I remember that during our first date, I stumbled upon a beautiful piece
      of driftwood on the lake shore. I decided to use it to draw a heart in the
      sand. Every time we visited that place, we would hide the driftwood and search
      for it again, rekindling the excitement of that first day. '

  - Text: The driftwood, now weather-worn and smooth from the constant handling,
      will always be a reminder of the love we share and the journey we had together
