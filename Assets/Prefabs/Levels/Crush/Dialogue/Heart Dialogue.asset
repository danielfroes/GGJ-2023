  - Text: Whenever any of us passed by the lakeside we'd check if the heart drawn
      in the sand was still visible. I drew it during our first date (I still can
      believe how silly I was! It was our first date!!) and we made a silent commitment
      to keep the drawing last for as long as possible.

  - Text: I have to admit that one day I went to the lakeside after a storm to redraw
      the heart. What can I do if I'm the last romantic?
