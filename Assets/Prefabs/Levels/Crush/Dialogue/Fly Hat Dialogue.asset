  - Text: During my first month in the village, my house was once visited by a cute
      little aphid with the cutest little hat. And before I could react to my finding,
      an even cuter Cashew started slamming my door. Even though you were visibly
      tired, out of breath, and sweaty, you still looked beautiful.

  - Text: And I think it was when you told me that the aphid was Giggle, the pest
      pet you kept in secret, that I started feeling something.
